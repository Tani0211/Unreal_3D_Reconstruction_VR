# VR-Based Photogrammetry Viewer

A modular desktop application that integrates **photogrammetry** and **virtual reality (VR)** to digitize real-world objects and interact with them in an immersive environment. The system allows users to generate textured 3D models from images and explore or manipulate them in VR.

This project was developed as a **group project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) course**, with a strong focus on clean design, modularity, and extensibility.

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern applications increasingly rely on photogrammetry and VR to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. This project combines existing photogrammetry pipelines with a VR-based visualization system, enabling users to:

- Input real-world images
- Generate textured 3D models
- Load and interact with those models in a VR environment

The architecture follows **Object-Oriented Programming principles**, ensuring maintainable and scalable code.

## 🚀 Features

- Runtime loading of **GLTF 3D models**
- Immersive **VR interaction** with 3D objects
- Object manipulation capabilities:
  - Grabbing
  - Scaling (up/down)
  - Real-time transformation
- Modular system design for easy extension
- Integration-ready with photogrammetry outputs

## 🧠 My Contribution

I was responsible for the **Virtual Reality and Unreal Engine development**, which included:

- Developing a **custom Unreal Engine package** for runtime loading of GLTF files
- Implementing VR interaction mechanics such as:
  - Object grabbing
  - Dynamic scaling
  - Spatial manipulation
- Integrating VR controllers for seamless user interaction
- Applying OOP principles to ensure reusable and maintainable Unreal Engine modules

Other parts of the system, including photogrammetry processing and application integration, were developed collaboratively by my teammates.
